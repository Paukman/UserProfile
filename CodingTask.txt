Coding Challenge

Create a user profile page using React.js that shows a user’s name, birthday, and favourite colour. 
The page should not be editable by default. But provide one or more buttons that allow the user to update the information. 
Once in the editing mode, provide a mechanism to persist / undo the changes and exit the editing mode. 
Use the user’s favourite colour as the background colour for all the buttons. 
Finally, if the user’s birthday is today then the profile page should wish the user a happy birthday.
